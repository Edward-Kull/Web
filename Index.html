            Programming is the act of constructing a program—a set of precise
            instructions telling a computer what to do. Because computers are
            dumb, pedantic beasts, programming is fundamentally tedious and
            frustrating. Fortunately, if you can get over that fact, and maybe
            even enjoy the rigor of thinking in terms that dumb machines can
            deal with, programming can be rewarding. It allows you to do things
            in seconds that would take forever by hand. It is a way to make your
            computer tool do things that it couldn’t do before. And it provides
            a wonderful exercise in abstract thinking.

          <p class="gradient-text">
            Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke is another best-selling
            JavaScript book. The best part about this web development book is
            that you can get it in Kindle or paperback format or read the online
            version for free. The book is up to date with recent JavaScript
            features, and it teaches you JavaScript through practical guides and
            projects. By the end of this book, you’ll walk away with hands-on
            experience on tasks like artificial life simulation, a simple
            programming language, and a paint program. The book is suitable for
            beginners.
